		Over the last few years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as MySpace and
		Facebook have attracted hundreds of millions of users and have been
		responsible for a new wave of popular application over the Internet. The
		dramatic increase in the popularity of OSNs have prompted network
		researchers and practitioners to examine the connectivity structure of
		well-known OSNs and the growth of their user population over time. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Online Social Network (OSN) are often represented as graph where nodes
		correspond to users and links reflect the friendship or interactions among
		users. Such graph representations can be annotated by various node or link
		attributes and are usually derived from a snapshot that is obtained through
		measurements of the system. These graph representations enable researchers
		to characterize the connectivity of these systems using various techniques
		from graph analysis and relying on an array of graph metrics such as degree
		distribution, diameter, clustering co-efficient. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Previous studies on networked systems that have adopted this approach
		typically suffer from three important shortcomings: 
		</p><ul>
		<li><b>Distorted Data</b>: Captured snapshots of large-scale networked systems are
		likely to be distorted which in turn leads to inaccurate representation of
		the system and thus to potentially incorrect results. 
		</li>

		<li>
		<b>Indirect Characterization</b>: commonly-used graph metrics or statistics,
		characterize the connectivity structure, only if the connectivity graph is indirect
		and thus have only limited use; One can produce a set of synthetic graphs which
		have the exact same metrics or statistics but exhibit fundamentally
		different connectivity structures. 
		</li>
		<li>
		<b>Graph Dynamics</b>: Evolution of OSNs is in general ignored despite the fact
		that most real-world OSNs evolve over time, often at a fast rate. In the
		absence of a more careful and meaningful characterization of graph
		connectivity, it is difficult to examine the structural properties of these
		system, study their evolution over time, or compare the connectivity graphs
		of different systems. 
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>

		<p>
		The goal of this multi-disciplinary project is to design, develop and
		rigorously evaluate theoretically grounded techniques to accurately measure
		and properly characterize the connectivity structure and in large-scale and
		dynamic networked systems with multi-attribute nodes or links. Furthermore,
		we explore social and technical root-causes of observed properties.

		<a name="Evol"></a><b>Evolution of User Population &amp; Their Activities in MySpace</b>            
		<p>
		While some empirical studies on Online Social Networks (OSNs) have examined
		the growth of these systems, little is known about the patterns of decline
		in user population or user activity (in terms of visiting their OSN account)
		in large OSNs, mainly because capturing the required information is
		challenging. 
		</p>
		<p>
		In this study, we examine the evolution of user population and user activity
		in a popular OSN, namely MySpace. Leveraging more than 360K randomly sampled
		profiles, we characterize both the pattern of departure and the level of
		activity among MySpace users. Our main findings can be summarized as
		follows: <i>(i)</i> A significant fraction of accounts have been deleted and a
		large fraction of valid accounts have not been visited for more than three
		months. <i>(ii)</i> One third of public accounts are owned by users who abandon
		their accounts shortly after creation (i.e., tourists). We leverage this
		information to estimate the account creation time of other users from their
		user IDs. <i>(iii)</i> We demonstrate that the growth of allocated user IDs in
		MySpace was exponential, followed by a sudden and significant slow-down in
		April 2008 due to an increase in the popularity of Facebook. If such up- and
		down-turns are symptomatic of OSNs, they raise the obvious question: What
		are the main forces that enable some systems to compete and OSN eco-system,
		while others d decline and ultimately die out? see our <a href="http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~moji/publication/wosn09.pdf">wosn'09 paper</a> for
		more details.

		<a name="Char"></a><b>Characterizing Fan-Owner Interactions in Flickr</b>
		<p>
		Most of the existing literature on empirical studies of Online Social
		Networks (OSNs) have focused on characterizing and modeling the structure of
		their inferred friendship graphs. However, the friendship graph of an OSN
		does not demonstrate what fraction of its users actively interact with other
		users, how these users interact, and how these active users and their
		interactions evolve over time. 
		</p>
		<p>
		In this study, we characterize indirect fan-owner interactions through
		photos among users in a large photo-sharing OSN, namely Flickr. Our results
		show that a very small fraction of users in the main component of the
		friendship graph is responsible for the vast majority of fan-owner
		interactions; moreover, these interactions involve only a small fraction of
		photos in Flickr. We also characterize some of the temporal properties of
		fan arrival. For example, we show that there is no strong correlation
		between age and popularity of a photo and that most photos gain a majority
		of their fans during the first week after their posting. Overall, our
		findings provide new insights into the fan-owner interactions among Flickr
		users. see our <a href="../../Masoud/WOSN09.pdf">wosn'09 paper</a>
		for more details.
		</p><br>

		<a name="Sampling"></a><b> Unbiased Sampling of User Properties</b>
		<p>
		Reliable characterization of OSNs requires capturing the accurate snapshots
		of their desired properties. OSN owners are often not willing to share this
		information due to privacy concerns.if Given the large size and dynamic
		nature of OSNs, it is often difficult to capture accurate snapshots of the
		system. Sampling is the most promising approach to characterize "user
		properties" without capturing complete snapshots of the system. In this
		project, we investigate the accuracy of sampling techniques that use some
		variations of random-walk, namely Metropolized Random Walk (MRW) Sampling
		and Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS), over graphs that OSNs are likely to
		exhibit.

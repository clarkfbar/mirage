            <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">Peer-to-Peer
                (P2P) streaming has become an increasing popular approach for
                one-to-many multimedia streaming applications, mainly because it does
                not require any special support (e.g. IP multicast or any content
                distribution infrastructure) from the network.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
                common theme in P2P streaming systems is that participating peers form
                an overlay where each peer receives content from one (or multiple)
                parent peer(s) in a session. <br>
                Any P2P streaming system consists of two distinct but related
                components:<br>
                <br>
            </div>

            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Goals of a live P2P streaming mechanism are maximizing
                the delivered quality to individual peers in a scalable fashion while utilizing the contributed resources
                (namely outgoing bandwidth) of all participating peers.
                In order to design such a mechanism with those goals challenges are:<br>
                <br>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; accommodating the heterogeneity and
                        asymmetry of access link bandwidth</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; coping with dynamics in peer participation.</li>
                </ul>
                <span class="GramE"></span>A well known approach to P2P
                streaming is to organize participating peers into multiple, diverse
                tree-shaped overlays where each specific sub-stream of the live content
                is <span style="font-style: italic;">pushed</span> through a
                particular tree from source to all interested peers e.g. Coopnet.
                This approach has the following potential limitations:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>in the presence of churn, maintaining multiple
                        diverse trees could be very challenging.</li>
                    <li>the rate of content delivery to each peer through
                        individual trees is limited by the minimum throughput among the
                        upstream connections.</li>
                    <li>the outgoing bandwidth of those peers that do not
                        have a sufficient number of child peers or an adequate amount of new
                        content can not be effectively utilized. This in turn limits the
                        scalability of the tree-based approaches.<br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <span style=""> </span>An alternative approach to P2P
                streaming is <span style="font-style: italic;">mesh-based P2P streaming</span>.
                In this approach participating peers form a mesh-shaped overlay and
                incorporate <span style="font-style: italic;">swarming</span> (or
                pull)
                content delivery. File swarming mechanisms e.g. Bittorrent, leverage
                the elastic nature and the availability of the entire file at the
                source to distribute different pieces of a file among participating
                peers, enabling them to actively contribute their outgoing bandwidth
                through swarming.
                However, incorporating swarming content delivery into mesh-based P2P
                streaming mechanisms for ``live'' content is challenging for two
                reasons:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Accommodating the streaming constraint of
                        in-time delivery for individual packets is difficult, and</li>
                    <li>Since the content is progressively generated by a
                        live source, the limited availability of future content limits the
                        diversity of available pieces among participating peers which in turn
                        degrades the utilization of their outgoing bandwidth.<br>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                The success
                of swarming content delivery has motivated a new
                approach to live Peer-to-Peer (P2P) streaming that we call
                mesh-based streaming. In this approach, participating peers
                form a random mesh and incorporate swarming content delivery to
                stream live content.
                Despite the growing popularity of this approach, neither the
                design tradeoffs nor the basic performance bottlenecks
                in mesh-based P2P streaming are well understood.
                We designed PRIME, the first mesh-based P2P streaming
                for live content that effectively incorporates swarming content
                delivery. We identify two performance bottlenecks in
                a mesh-based P2P streaming, namely <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">bandwidth bottleneck</span> </span>and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">content bottleneck</span>.
                We derive proper peer connectivity
                to minimize bandwidth bottleneck as well as an efficient pattern of
                delivery for live content over a random mesh to minimize content
                bottleneck.
                We show that the pattern of delivery can be divided into
                diffusion and swarming phases and then identify proper
                packet scheduling algorithm at individual peers.
                Using ns simulations, we examine key characteristics, design tradeoffs
                and the relationship between main system parameters.<br>

                Peer-to-Peer streaming
                overlays
                consist
                of peers with heterogeneous, asymmetric and limited bandwidth. A
                reasonable approach to maximize the delivered quality to individual
                peers in such an environment is to ensure that delivered quality to
                each peer is proportional to its contribution. In essence the delivered quality in
                a resource-constraint P2P streaming system should be contribution aware.
                The contribution-aware paradigm not only promotes the fairness among
                peers, but also serves as an effective means to encourage peers to
                contribute. Incorporating contribution-awareness into P2P streaming is
                challenging. In this project, the contribution awareness mechanism is
                incorporated into a mesh-based P2P live streaming, and its
                performance is extensively studied. Our mail goal is to deliver a
                persistent quality to individual peers proportional to their
                contribution while maximizing the utilization of the resources in the
                system. Through extensive evaluation we show that the
                contribution-awareness mechanism in a mesh-based
                P2P streaming is achievable, i.e. peers received quality is
                proportional to
                their contribution while resources in the system is fully utilized.

                Existing approaches to P2P
                streaming can be divided into two
                general classes: (i) tree-based approaches use push-based content
                delivery over
                multiple tree-shaped overlays, and (ii) mesh-based approaches use
                swarming content delivery over a
                randomly connected mesh. Previous studies have often focused on a
                particular P2P streaming mechanism and no comparison between these two
                classes has been conducted.
                In this project, we compare and contrast the performance of
                representative protocols from each class using simulations.
                We identify the similarities and differences between these two
                approaches. Furthermore, we separately examine the behavior of content
                delivery and overlay construction mechanisms for both approaches in
                static and dynamic scenarios.
                Our results indicate that the mesh-based approach consistently exhibits
                a superior performance over the tree-based approach. We also show that
                the main factors attributing in the inferior performance of the
                tree-based approach are
                (i) the static mapping of content to a particular tree, and (ii) the
                placement of each peer as an internal node in one tree and as a leaf in
                all other trees.

                The behavior of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) streaming mechanism in sessions
                where a large fraction of peers are residential peers have not been
                examined.
                Several characteristics of residential users could affect the behavior
                of P2P streaming sessions including
                (i) the heterogeneity of access link bandwidth, (ii) the limitation of
                available resources due to asymmetric nature of access link bandwidth
                (for DSL and cable modem), and (iii) the participation of free-loaders.
                In this project, we examine the effect of these three characteristics
                of residential users on the performance of P2P streaming mechanisms
                using ns simulations. We show that these characteristics could
                adversely affect the performance of P2P streaming mechanisms as
                follows; First, the delivered quality to individual users is not
                correlated with their
                contributed resource to the system. Second, the presence of
                free-loaders could dramatically degrade the delivered quality to
                participating peers even when the amount of available resources in the
                system
                are adequate. Our findings suggest that P2P streaming should be able to
                address these issues in order to be successfully deployed among
                residential users.

                Mesh-based Peer-to-Peer streaming mechanisms incorporate swarming
                content
                delivery and thus are able to support scalable streaming of live content.
                Their key component is a packet scheduling scheme at each peer
                that determines pulled packet from neighbors while accommodating
                in-time arrival and diversity of delivered packets.
                Besides packet scheduling scheme, the overall performance of a mesh-based P2P streaming mechanism
                also depends on the availability of excess resources in the system.
                Recently proposed mesh-based P2P streaming mechanisms have been evaluated
                in a scenario-rich setting. Thus, neither their performance in a resource
                constraint scenario nor the separate effect of packet scheduling and
                available
                resources on their performance is known.
                In this project, we dissect the performance of mesh-based P2P streaming mechanism and investigate
                the effect of packet scheduling and available resource on their performance.
                We argue that the global pattern of content delivery primarily determines
                behavior of a mesh-based P2P streaming system. We present a new evaluation methodology that
                properly captures this pattern. Using our evaluation methodology,
                we examine the performance of representative scheduling schemes and
                the role of available resources. Our findings provide useful insights
                in design and evaluation of mesh-based P2P streaming mechanisms.

                In Swarm-based Peer-to-Peer Streamiing (SPS) mechanisms, participating
                peers form a randomly connected mesh over which they incorporate swarm-like
                content delivery. In
                practice, a subset of participating peers may form clusters in the overlay
                due to various reasons
                such as localization of connectivity within edge ISPs. Despite the commonly
                held assumptions, the appearance of such clusters could significantly
                degrade the
                delivered quality to participating peers in SPS mechanisms.</p>
                <p>This project examines the effect of overlay clustering on the
                performance of SPS mechanisms for live content. Leveraging the
                notion of two-phase content delivery in SPS mechanisms, we illustrate the effect of
                overlay clustering on content delivery. We propose the Overlay
                Monitoring and Repair (OMR) mechanism as a distributed and scalable approach to maintain proper
                overlay connectivity in SPS mechanisms. The key idea is to use delivered
                quality to individual peers as an indication of poor connectivity from
                other regions of the overlay. OMR employs a probabilistic approach to
                ensure an adequate number of properly-positioned
                peers reacts to detected clustering in the overlay without any coordination.
                Reacting peers rewire a small number of carefully-selected connections in the overlay
                to significantly improve the performance of content delivery. </p>

                P2P streaming applications have been widely used for scalable streaming of
                live multimedia over the Internet. Their high bandwidth demand potentially can result in
                generating a significant amount of network traffic. P2P
                applications build a random overlay among peers and often ignore the
                underlying network topology. This imposes a significant amount of
                costly traffic on ISPs. For this reason, ISPs try to reduce the costly inter-ISP traffic by
                various means and thus, localized the P2P traffic. Localization can
                significantly degrades the performance of live P2P
                streaming applications. In a localized P2P
                overlay, there may not be adequate shortcuts throughout the varous
                parts of the overlay to ensure the diversity of content in each neighborhood. Thus,
                localization may results in decreasing the diversity of content in each peer's
                neighborhood and stretching the shape of the random P2P overlay. We propose the first
                ISP-friendly Swarm-based P2P streaming mechanism with the goal of maintaining the P2P
                streaming application performance while reducing inter-ISPs traffic. In
                essence, we design an ISP-friendly block scheduling algorithm that
                considers the localized topology of the P2P overlay for smart block scheduling.
                Our evaluation results demonstrate that through the proposed ISP-friendly
                mechanism, the delivered quality to individual peers in a localized overlay is
                comparable to the peers' quality in a random overlay.

                <p>The ION P2P Project aims to improve our understanding of Peer-to-Peer
                systems by answering two fundamental questions:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>How do we collect accurate measurements from P2P systems?</li>
                    <li>What are useful models to characterize their components?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To answer these questions, we pursue the following goals: <em>(i)</em>
                develop and verify accurate measurements techniques, <em>(ii)</em> present
                empirical results which may be used to evaluate models and improve our
                understanding of existing systems, and <em>(iii)</em> suggest useful
                models based on the empirical observations.</p>

                    <p>Peer-to-peer systems are becoming increasingly popular, with millions
                    of simultaneous users and covering a wide range of applications, from
                    file-sharing programs like LimeWire and eMule to Internet telephony
                    services such as Skype.  Understanding existing systems and devising
                    new P2P techniques relies on having access to representative models
                    derived from empirical observations of existing systems.  However, the
                    large and dynamic nature of P2P systems makes capturing accurate
                    measurements challenging.</p>
                    <p>While some prior studies have attempted to characterize different
                    aspects of P2P systems, they have not taken the first step of
                    critically examining their measurement tools (<em>i.e.</em>, answering the
                    first question), leading to conflicting results or conclusions based
                    on measurement artifacts (<em>e.g.</em>, power-law degree distributions may
                    be the result of measurement error).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h1><a id="developing-accurate-measurement-techniques" name="developing-accurate-measurement-techniques">Developing Accurate Measurement Techniques</a></h1>
                    <p>There are two basic approaches to collecting measurements from P2P
                    systems, each with advantages and disadvantages.  The first approach
                    is to <a class="reference" href="cruiser.html">capture a global view</a> by collecting data about every peer in
                    the system.  The advantage of this approach is that all the
                    information is available.  The typical problem with this approach is
                    that the state changes while the measurement tool communicates with
                    the peers, leading to a distorted view of the system.  The longer the
                    tool requires to capture the global view, the more distorted the
                    data.  Additionally, capturing a global view does not scale well.  As
                    P2P systems grow larger, capturing a global view becomes more time
                    consuming, leading to greater distortion.  To be at all practical,
                    capturing a global view requires an exceptionally fast tool able to
                    gather data from a large number of peers very quickly.</p>
                    <p>The second approach is to <a class="reference" href="sampling.html">collect local samples</a>.  The advantage of
                    this approach is that it scales well.  The Law of Large Numbers from
                    statistics tells us that the average from a large number of samples
                    will closely approximate the true average, regardless of the
                    population size.  One disadvantage of sampling is that we cannot
                    easily use samples to examine certain properties which are
                    fundamentally global in nature.  For example, we cannot compute the
                    diameter of a graph based on local observations at several peers.
                    More importantly, if the collected samples are biased in some way, the
                    resulting data may lead us to incorrect conclusions.  For this reason,
                    capturing samples requires validation of the sampling tool, which must
                    be carefully designed to avoid bias.</p>

                    <p>Systematically tackling the problem of characterizing P2P systems
                    requires a structured organization of the different components.  At
                    the most basic level, a P2P system consists of a set of connected
                    peers.  We can view this as a graph with the peers as vertices and the
                    connections as edges.  One fundamental way we can divide the problem
                    space is into <em>properties of the peers</em> versus <em>properties of the way
                        peers are connected</em>.  Another fundamental division is examining the
                    way the system <em>is</em> versus the way the system <em>evolves</em>.
                    The table below presents an overview of several interesting
                    properties categorized by whether they are static or dynamic, and
                    whether they are peer properties or connectivity properties.</p>
